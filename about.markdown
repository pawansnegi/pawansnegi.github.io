### Welcome to my website!!!

I am a research scholar at [IIT Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in). My current area
of research is smoothed particle hydrodynamics, meshless methods, and the method of
manufactured solutions (MMS). My current work is on the construction of MMS for
weakly-compressible SPH schemes.

Apart from these, I have an interest in Wavelet-based solution of partial
differential equations, Machine learning, and deep learning.
