I am a research scholar at [IIT Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in). My current
areas of research are smoothed particle hydrodynamics, meshless methods, and the
method of manufactured solutions (MMS). My current work is on the construction
of methods for verification of weakly-compressible SPH schemes.

I also have an interest in Wavelet-based methods for solving partial
differential equations and physics informed neural networks.

My research group headed by [Prof. Prabhu
Ramachandran](https://www.aero.iitb.ac.in/~prabhu/) at IITB make all our
research available at [https://gitlab.com/pypr](https://gitlab.com/pypr) in the
interest of reproducibility.

Apart from research, I play ultimate frisbee. IITB has an unofficial club called
[*Night Crawlers*](https://www.facebook.com/iitbultimatefrisbee/) for all the
ultimate enthusiast. I also participated in the Mumbai Ultimate League (MUL
2021), and played for *Icebreakers*.
