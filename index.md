I am a Senior Research Associate at the Illinois Institute of Technology in
Chicago. My research interests include smoothed particle hydrodynamics,
meshless methods, boundary integral methods, interfacial flows, and machine
learning methods for solving partial differential equations. Currently, I
am focused on developing numerical solutions for elliptical problems with
variable coefficients. Apart from research, I teach calculus as a part of
my teaching training at Illinois tech.

I completed my Ph.D. at IIT Bombay under the guidance of Prof. Prabhu
Ramachandran. Our research group at IIT Bombay is dedicated to sharing our
work in the interest of reproducibility. You can find our research
publications and projects on the GitLab repository at
https://gitlab.com/pypr.

Outside of academia, I enjoy playing ultimate frisbee. During my time at
IIT Bombay, I was an active member of the Ultimate Frisbee Club. Nowadays,
I occasionally join the Chicago Ultimate group on weekends for some
friendly matches. As a "pahari," I also have a love for trekking and
exploring the mountains.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or if there's anything
else you'd like to know about my work or interests!
