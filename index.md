I am a research scholar at [IIT Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in). My current
areas of research are smoothed particle hydrodynamics, meshless methods, and the
method of manufactured solutions (MMS). My current work is on the construction
of methods for verification of weakly-compressible SPH schemes.

I also have an interest in Wavelet-based methods for solving partial
differential equations and physics informed neural networks.

Apart from these, I play ultimate frisbee a lot and currently a member of the
unofficial IIT Bombay club "Night Crawlers". I participated in the Mumbai
Ultimate League (MUL 2021), and played for "Icebreakers".
